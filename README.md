# TF2-NominationHandler  
### A simple nomination handler for when you don't need complex sorting  

This plugin was written specifically for one of my dev/sandbox servers, so it may require modifications to suit your needs.  

Notes:  
- Reads in map groups from ecj_mapcycle.txt. When modifications are done to this file, run ```sm_updatemaplist``` to have the plugin update your mapcycle file as well.
  
To Do:  
- Add cvars instead of hardcoding certain things, such as message prefixes or config file name.  
- Add autoexec.
